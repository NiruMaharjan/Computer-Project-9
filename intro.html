<h1> Spain</h1>
      <h2>  Spain (Spanish: España, [esˈpaɲa]), or the Kingdom of Spain (Reino de España),[g] is a 
        country in southwestern Europe with parts of territory in the Atlantic Ocean and across the
         Mediterranean Sea. The largest part of Spain is situated on the Iberian Peninsula; its 
         territory also includes the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, the Balearic Islands in the
          Mediterranean Sea, and the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla in Africa. The country's 
          mainland is bordered to the south by Gibraltar; to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea;
           to the north by France, Andorra and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west by Portugal and the
            Atlantic Ocean.</h2>

<h2>With an area of 505,990 km2 (195,360 sq mi), Spain is the second-largest country in the European Union
 (EU) and, with a population exceeding 47.4 million, the fourth-most populous EU member state. Spain's 
 capital and largest city is Madrid; other major urban areas include Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, 
 Zaragoza, Málaga, Murcia, Palma de Mallorca, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Bilbao.

Anatomically modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 42,000 years ago. Pre-Roman
 peoples dwelled in the territory, in addition to the development of coastal trading colonies by
  Phoenicians and Ancient Greeks and the brief Carthaginian rule over the Mediterranean coastline. The
   Roman conquest and colonization of the peninsula (Hispania) ensued, bringing a Roman acculturation of 
   the population.</h2>

  <h2>Hispania remained under Roman rule until the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the fourth century,
 which ushered in the migration of Germanic peoples and the Alans into the peninsula. Eventually, the 
 Visigoths emerged as the dominant power in the peninsula by the fifth century. In the early eighth 
 century, most of the peninsula was conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate and during early Islamic rule,
  Al-Andalus became the dominant peninsular power, centered in Córdoba. Several Christian kingdoms emerged
   in Northern Iberia, chief among them León, Castile, Aragón, Portugal, and Navarre and over the next
    seven centuries, an intermittent southward expansion of these kingdoms, known as Reconquista, 
    culminated with the Christian seizure of the Emirate of Granada in 1492. Jews and Muslims were forced
     to choose between conversion to Catholicism or expulsion and the Morisco converts were eventually
      expelled. The dynastic union of the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon was followed by the
       annexation of Navarre and the 1580 incorporation of Portugal (which ended in 1640). In the wake of
        the Spanish colonization of the Americas after 1492, the Crown came to hold a large overseas 
        empire, which underpinned the emergence of a global trading system primarily fuelled by the 
        precious metals extracted in the New World.

Centralisation of the administration and further State-building in mainland Spain ensued in the 18th and
 19th centuries, during which the Crown saw the loss of the bulk of its American colonies a few years 
 after of the Peninsular War. The country veered between different political regimes; monarchy and
 republic, and following a 1936–39 devastating civil war, a fascist dictatorship that lasted until 1975.</h2>
