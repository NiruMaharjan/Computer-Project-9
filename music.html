<h1>
In Spain, music has a long history. It has played an important role in the development of Western music, 
and has greatly influenced Latin American music. Spanish music is often associated with traditional styles
 such as flamenco and classical guitar. While these forms of music are common, there are many different 
 traditional musical and dance styles across the regions. For example, music from the north-west regions
  is heavily reliant on bagpipes, the jota is widespread in the centre and north of the country, and 
  flamenco originated in the south. Spanish music played a notable part in the early developments of 
  western classical music, from the 15th through the early 17th century. The breadth of musical innovation
   can be seen in composers like Tomás Luis de Victoria, styles like the zarzuela of Spanish opera, the 
   ballet of Manuel de Falla, and the classical guitar music of Francisco Tárrega. Nowadays commercial pop
    music dominates.

<h1>The Iberian peninsula has had a history of receiving different musical influences from around the  
  Mediterranean Sea and across Europe. In the two centuries before the Christian era, Roman rule brought 
  with it the music and ideas of Ancient Greece; early Christians, who had their own differing versions
   of church music arrived during the height of the Roman Empire; the Visigoths, a Romanized Germanic 
   people, who took control of the peninsula following the fall of the Roman Empire; the Moors and Jews
    in the Middle Ages. Hence, there have been more than two thousand years of internal and external 
    influences and developments that have produced a large number of unique musical traditions.</h1>
