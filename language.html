                <h2>Spanish (español or castellano, lit. “Castilian”) is a Romance language of the 
                Indo-European language family that evolved from colloquial spoken Latin in the Iberian
                 Peninsula of Europe. Today, it is a global language with nearly 500 million native 
                 speakers, mainly in the Americas and Spain. Spanish is the official language of 20 
                 countries. It is the world's second-most spoken native language after Mandarin Chinese;
                  the world's fourth-most spoken language overall after English, Mandarin Chinese,
                  and Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu); and the world's most widely spoken Romance language. The 
                  largest population of native speakers is in Mexico.</h2>

<h2>Spanish is part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages, which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar 
Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century. The oldest Latin texts
 with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century, and the first systematic
  written use of the language happened in Toledo, a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile, in the 13th
   century. Spanish colonialism in the Early Modern Period spurred on the introduction of the language to
    overseas locations, most notably to the Americas.</h2>

<h2>As a Romance language, Spanish is a descendant of Latin and has one of the smaller degrees of difference
 from it (about 20%) alongside Sardinian and Italian.[9] Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is
  derived from Latin, including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek. Alongside English and French,
   it is also one of the most taught foreign languages throughout the world. Spanish does not feature 
   prominently as a scientific language; however, it is better represented in areas like humanities and
    social sciences.[13] Spanish is also the third most used language on internet websites after English 
    and Chinese.</h2>

<h2>Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations, and it is also used as an official 
language by the European Union, the Organization of American States, the Union of South American Nations,
 the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, the African Union and many other international 
 organizations.</h2>
